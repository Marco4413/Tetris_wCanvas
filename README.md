## What's special about this game?

It was made by using my own library to make canvas interactions easier! You can check it out [@wCanvas's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hds536jhmk/wCanvas).

## I've got issues on mobile, what can I do?

This game isn't really meant to work well on mobile, it was designed to be played on a computer, although it offers some quality of life stuff on mobile, like a mini controller with which you will be able to kind of play it.

## What are the key bindings for this game?
 - **W** or **UP ARROW** : Rotates the tetromino;
 - **S** or **DOWN ARROW** : Moves down the tetromino;
