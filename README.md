## What's special about this game?

It was made using my own library to make canvas interactions easier! You can check it out [@wCanvas's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hds536jhmk/wCanvas).

## I've got issues on mobile, what can I do?

This game isn't really meant to work well on mobile, it was designed to be played on a computer, although it offers some quality of life stuff on mobile, like a mini controller with which you will be able to kind of play it.

**Enjoy This Game!**
